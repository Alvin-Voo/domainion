TODO:
1. players.sol - getMyDomains() and getMyInfo() change to with address argument better for testing? Safety concern?
2. redux-persist - to rehydrate popup state once browser restarts
3. 'Join' button switch to a 'start screen' before actual content
4. Need to better handle the screen transition in state. e.g fade in out delay before refresh page?
